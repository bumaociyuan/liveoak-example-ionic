    This is an example of <a href="http://liveoak.io/" target="_blank">LiveOak</a> based app running on Ionic platform.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This application is a derivate of so-called "drill" applications used for studying foreign vocabulary. It is
    inspired by the Langdrill application from Linux systems.</p>
    <h2>Test</h2>
    <p>To start learning the vocabulary, click on the "Start Quiz" button. The question (word to be translated) is
    printed on the top of the screen. The goal is to select the correct one from all the possible options. Each question
    is repeated until you correctly answer it for three times. Once you succeed to answer each question correctly three
    times in a row, this question won't be repeated again.</p>
    <p>To stop the quiz, click the "Stop Quiz" button.</p>
